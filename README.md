# The-Drake-Equation
Drake Equation Calculator
A C++ implementation of the Drake equation for estimating the number of potential alien civilizations in the universe, developed for CISP360 Structured Programming course.

Overview
The Drake equation, named after Dr. Frank Drake, is used to estimate the number of communicating extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy. This program calculates the equation using predefined variables and performs sensitivity analysis on the results.

Drake Equation Formula
N = R × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L*

Where:

N = Number of potential alien civilizations (etCiv in code)

R* = Rate of star creation

fp = Percentage of stars with planets

ne = Number of planets per star capable of supporting life

fl = Percentage that go on to develop life

fi = Percentage that go on to develop intelligent life

fc = Percentage that develop detectable communications

L = Lifetime of civilizations
